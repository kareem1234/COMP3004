This folder contains two executables, the client and the server. 
The server executable is in the ServerNetworking folder while the client is in the Client networking folder.

First compile and run the server then do the same for the client. Using 'qmake' then 'make' in both cases.

There are several users you can log in as.

You should use 'edna@carleton.ca' for the Instructor. She has several TAs assigned to her courses: 'mary@carleton.ca', 'billy@carleton.ca', and 'sally@carleton.ca'. You must select the appropriate user type from the dropdown to login.

As an instructor you can select a course you are teaching. Then select a TA assigned to the course. You can then create a new task for the TA. Once a task is created, a number of more options become available. You can edit the selected task, view the evaluation for the task, or delete the task. 
To manage a Task's evaluation, you click the view evaluation button. If an evaluation has not yet been created for the task, you can create one. If there is one already created, you can either edit it or delete it.


The TA user can simply view their assigned Tasks and corresponding evaluations. This functionality is straightforward. The TA can also refresh their task list with the 'Reload' button.
